That’s the power of quantum computing in generative AI. \n\nUnlike classical bits (0s and 1s), quantum bits (qubits) can be both at once, thanks to superposition. And with entanglement, qubits can sync states across any distance, enabling parallel computations at unimaginable speeds!\n\nHere's the 'quantum computing for beginners' version.\n \nDive deep into generative AI and all things related with our Future of Data and AI Podcast here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFwLx_fDQxk&list=PL8eNk_zTBST9IKvQ9hxhotO4Xtehx7QN8\n \n#ai #generativeai #quantumcomputing #quantummechanics #machinelearning #llm #largelanguagemodels #llmdojo",

While reviewing the bootcamp he mentioned :\" This certification has deepened my expertise in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in advanced techniques like query optimization, vector databases such as Weaviate, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). \n\nOne of the highlights was understanding when and how to fine-tune models, the distinctions between lexical (keyword) and semantic search, and the critical aspects of MLOps. The practical experience of creating models with LangChain and developing chatbot applications in Streamlit has been rewarding. This completion equips me with the tools to make meaningful contributions in the field of AI. Special thanks to the top-tier speakers and my incredible cohorts who made this learning journey so impactful.\n\n💼 Learn to build LLM-powered apps in just 40 hours with our Large Language Models bootcamp both online and in-person ➡️ https://datasciencedojo.com/bootcamps/large-language-models-bootcamp/?utm_campaign=Social%20Media%20Marketing%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_term=video_beginner&utm_content=lm_models\n\n#largelanguagemodels #LLM #bootcamp",
